# Pokedex project

This project follows [this React tutorial from Theodo](https://github.com/theodo/formation-dev/blob/master/react/react.md/). A Redux and Saga logic was then added.


It shows the complete pokedex of Gen 1 Pokemon. Click on the sprite to display name, sprite, weight and first ability.
